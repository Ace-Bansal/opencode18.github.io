Opencode is an open source event aimed to raise awareness about open source. It is a month long event where participants contribute to different projects and earn points simultaneously. A minified version of GSOC, OpenCode is organised by the FOSS wing of IIIT-Allahabad's technical society, Geekhaven.
## How this works?
* Participants are required to solve the issues and earn points.
